Core Elements of a Programming Language

1. Data and Types
- Basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Variables and constants
- Type system (static vs dynamic typing)
- Data structures (arrays, records/objects)

2. Control Flow
- Sequential execution
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops and iteration
- Function calls and returns
- Exception handling

3. Operations
- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators 
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators

4. Modularity
- Functions/procedures
- Scope rules
- Parameter passing
- Return values

5. Syntax and Grammar
- Keywords and reserved words
- Expression syntax
- Statement delimiters
- Block structure
- Comments

6. Semantics
- Evaluation rules
- Type checking rules
- Binding rules
- Execution model
